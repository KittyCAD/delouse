The next steps are going to be loading this core into a debugger to
try and figure out what's been going on with the process. If you're
running locally, you can load the core by using gdb.

  - If the coredump isn't where you expect, check where your system
    generates coredumps by running:

    $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

    The meaning of the %* patterns is defined in `man 5 core`.

  - If it's still not where you expect, double check the binary is
    capable of writing to the location in `core_pattern`.

  - Still can't find the core? Check your coredump ulimit, and make
    sure that this is large enough (in bytes) for the coredump you're
    generating.

    $ ulimit -c -H

  - Load the binary in `gdb` using a command that's similar to:

    $ rust-gdb {:?} core

    Adjusting `core` to be where your corefile is located based on your
    system.
